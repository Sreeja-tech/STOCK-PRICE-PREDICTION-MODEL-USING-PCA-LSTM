# STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION-MODEL-USING-PCA-LSTM

Our main objective was to predict stock prices. To do so, we had to reduce the many features that affect the stock’s price. We used the Machine Learning algorithm of Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to extract the most important features.We then had to predict the stock price for today based on yesterday for which we made use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

Gathered 5 years’ worth of HDFC and IDFC datasets from Yahoo Finance for analysis. We fixed a time period of 5 years for each bank, as this included all the highs & lows. The reason for choosing HDFC was that it is a very well performing and stable stock which continuously showed profits. However, on the other hand IDFC was a stock that performed poorly over the chosen time-period. So these two stocks contrasted well. 

Using LSTM, We were able to predict the stock prices for the next 30 days based on past data.
